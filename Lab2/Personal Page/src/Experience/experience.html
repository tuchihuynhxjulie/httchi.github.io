                    <p>
                        This project represents an OOP design for the popular Flappy Bird. This game is structured into multiple classes, 
                        each responsible for different aspects of the game, such as the bird’s movement, obstacle management, 
                        and the overall game flow. The OOP approach enables modular, maintainable, and scalable code, making it 
                        easier to add new features or modify existing ones.

                        An interactive chart app is a piece of software that enablesusers to dynamically and engrossingly create, 
                        alter, and interact with charts and graphs. Users can enter data and have it converted into a variety of 
                        graphic representations, including pie charts, scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, and more.
                        An interactive chart app's capacity to allow users to dynamically change and examine the chart is its defining 
                        feature. In order to study the data from numerous perspectives, users frequently interact with the data points,
                        pan across the chart, zoom in or out, and apply various filters. They might also have the choice to click on 
                        a specific area of a pie chart to dig down into subcategories, hover over data points to view more granular 
                        information or do any number of other things.

                        In this project, we delve into the realm of interactive charts as a powerful tool for elucidating
                        the multifaceted topic of "Causes of Death in the World." These interactive visualizations allow 
                        us to explore and understand complex global mortality patterns better. We investigate various 
                        causes of death, including communicable diseases and non-communicable ailments, analyzing regional 
                        and demographic disparities.

                    <p>
                        We use some model in Machine Learning to train dataset.The dataset consists of 5,863 chest 
                        X-ray images (JPEG) categorized into Pneumonia and Normal, organized into three folders 
                        (train, test, and validation) with subfolders for each category. 
                        The images were taken from pediatric patients aged one to five at Guangzhou Women and 
                        Children’s Medical Center. All X-rays were screened for quality, and the diagnoses were graded 
                        by two expert physicians. A third expert reviewed the evaluation set to ensure accuracy, aiming 
                        to reduce grading errors before training an AI system.

                        For our Software Engineering project, our team of ten collaborated on developing a comprehensive
                        web application. Leveraging the power of ReactJS for frontend development, we crafted an
                        intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances user experience. In parallel, we utilized
                        MySQL to design and manage the underlying database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of
                        data. To bolster security features, we implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
                        and authorization, safeguarding sensitive user information and ensuring secure access to the
                        application's features. Through close collaboration and division of tasks, we successfully
                        integrated these technologies to create a robust and functional software solution that meets the
                        requirements of modern web development standards.
