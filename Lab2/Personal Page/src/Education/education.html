                        As a fourth-year student majoring in Computer Science at the School of Information Technology,
                        International University (IU) - Vietnam National University, I am deeply passionate about the
                        field of technology and its endless possibilities. Being part of the first and only public
                        university in Vietnam to offer a fully English-taught program, my educational journey has been
                        enriched with global perspectives, diverse cultural exchanges, and a rigorous academic
                        curriculum.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my academic tenure, I have been exposed to cutting-edge technologies,
                        industry-relevant projects, and hands-on experiences that have equipped me with the necessary
                        skills and knowledge to thrive in today's fast-paced digital landscape. The faculty members at
                        IU are not only experts in their respective fields but also mentors who have guided me in honing
                        my critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication abilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moreover, the multicultural environment at IU has provided me with invaluable opportunities to
                        collaborate with peers from various backgrounds, fostering teamwork, cross-cultural
                        understanding, and adaptability – essential qualities in the globalized world we live in today.
